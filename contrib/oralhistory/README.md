These are models and decoder graphs for oral history interviews (OH), parliamentary talks (PR), and daily conversations (GN), respectively named decoder_OH.sh, decoder_PR.sh and decode_GN.sh.

They are not meant to be run directly from this directory, install them with ``configure.sh oralhistory`` and run the linked scripts from the root directory of the repository.
